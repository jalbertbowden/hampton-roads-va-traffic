Actions – Park and Ride,
TRAFFIX encourages ride-sharing by promoting and administering park and,
ride lots. There are currently 20 park & ride lots in Hampton Roads including,
a park & sail lot for the Paddlewheel Ferry and four park & ride lots for The,
Tide light rail.,
TRAFFIX created or brokered the park and ride locations indicated by,
"“TRAFFIX” on the map, and promotes the remaining park and ride lots to",
"commuters who wish to carpool, vanpool, or ride public transit.",
TRAFFIX provides assigned parking spots at the Park & Sail lot in Portsmouth,
for commuters who use the lot a minimum of three times per week. This,
service has declined from 103 spaces assigned in FY 2008 to 57 spaces,
assigned in FY 2011.,
"To serve some of the stations for The Tide light rail, there are four new park &",
ride lots with approximately 800 parking spaces that opened with The Tide,
in August 2011. TRAFFIX staff is working on increasing the number of park &,
ride spaces available for commuters on the light rail during FY 2012.,
TRAFFIX staff is currently conducting an inventory of all park and ride,
"locations in Hampton Roads, including number of spaces available, which",
will be available for future annual reports.,
