Summary,
"The TRAFFIX program is an important part of the Hampton Roads transportation system, encouraging the reduction of single",
occupancy vehicles on the roadways through its many programs. TRAFFIX had success in FY 2011 in expanding many,
"programs and serving many people in Hampton Roads. However, there are a few instances where this growth is limited, namely",
"Telework!VA and vanpooling. Consequently, TRAFFIX may wish to consider budgeting for the purchase of additional vans in",
future years.,
"This annual report was completed by HRTPO staff to inform the TOS, TPS, TTAC, and HRTPO Board of TRAFFIX performance.",
"It provides a template and baseline data set for future annual reports to be completed by TRAFFIX. Using the consistent,",
"meaningful performance measures shown in this report, the TOS can monitor the impact of TRAFFIX on Hampton Roads and",
ensure that the allocations given to TRAFFIX are at an appropriate level.,
This report reflects the programs and performance measures in place during FY 2011. Additional performance measures should,
be collected so that the number of person-trips reduced per year can be calculated for all TRAFFIX programs. The performance,
measures for the NuRide program can also be enhanced by tracking the number of trips by mode that are reported in NuRide.,
"As TRAFFIX implements new programs, it can add additional performance measures. One such program for FY 2012 is the",
"Go365 program, which allows schools and businesses to purchase a years’ worth of unlimited rides for their students and",
"employees. Suggested performance measures for this program include the number of schools and businesses participating,",
"the number of individuals eligible for Go365 passes, and the number of rides taken using Go365 passes (as tracking becomes",
available).,
