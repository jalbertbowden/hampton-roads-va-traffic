The HRTPO Board funds TRAFFIX using federal Congestion Mitigation and,
Air Quality (CMAQ) funds. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) limits,

"vehicles on the roadway – and therefore vehicle emissions – in the region,",

"years. In March 2010, the HRTPO Board allocated $1,000,000 per year in",
"CMAQ, including state match, for FY 2011 through FY 2015. In March 2011,",
"the $1,000,000 per year CMAQ allocation was extended through FY 2017",
"in March 2011. In December 2011, $1,100,000 was allocated for FY 2018.",
With previous CMAQ and Regional Surface Transportation Program (RSTP),
