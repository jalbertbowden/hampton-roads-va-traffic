TRAFFIX Annual Report 2012,vi
Introduction,
TRAFFIX was established in 1995 as a Transportation Demand Management (TDM) service for Hampton Roads. The service,
aims to reduce traffic congestion by reducing the number of single occupancy vehicles commuting to work. The service,
"promotes transportation alternatives, such as carpooling, vanpooling, public transportation, teleworking, and alternate work",
schedules.,
"TRAFFIX staff are employees of Hampton Roads Transit (HRT); however, funding is provided through the Hampton Roads",
Transportation Planning Organization (HRTPO). The HRTPO has authorized annual funding for TRAFFIX through Congestion,
Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) and/or Regional Surface Transportation Program (RSTP) funding since Fiscal Year (FY) 1995.,
"The TRAFFIX Oversight Subcommittee (TOS), made up of transportation professionals from the cities and counties in the",
"Metropolitan Planning Area (MPA), the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT), Federal Highway Administration (FHWA),",
"and the Virginia Department of Rail and Public Transportation (DRPT), reviews the progress and status of TRAFFIX three times",
"per year. The TOS reports to the Transportation Technical Advisory Committee (TTAC), which in turn reports to the HRTPO",
board.,
TRAFFIX administers many programs internally and also advertises TDM programs administered by outside organizations.,
"The Commuter Computer, Vanpool Program, Guaranteed Ride Program, and park & ride lots are operated by TRAFFIX, while",
NuRide and Telework!VA are programs of other agencies which TRAFFIX promotes for Hampton Roads.,
"Although TRAFFIX has provided performance measures to the TOS and TTAC in the past, this report expands on the previous",
performance measures and creates a standardized list of performance measures for TRAFFIX. While TRAFFIX began operations,
"in 1995, the detailed performance data that TRAFFIX provided for this report is available beginning with FY 2007, and thus the",
"baseline data provided in this report covers FY 2007 through FY 2011. Throughout this report, the fiscal year refers to the state",
"fiscal year, which runs from July of the previous year to June of the current year.",

Actions,
TRAFFIX Annual Report 2012,2
Actions - Outreach,
TRAFFIX staff makes an effort every year to visit local employers to,
"promote alternative commuting options. During visits to worksites,",
TRAFFIX staff provides information on the various TRAFFIX programs,
as well as answers specific questions on alternative commuting,
options available to the employees at that particular worksite.,
"Since 2008, TRAFFIX has designated a specific staff member as the",
Military and Government Outreach Coordinator. This has allowed,
"the military outreach to grow each year, from 10 commands in FY",
2007 to 105 commands in FY 2011. The Military and Government,
Outreach Coordinator contacts and visits individual commands,
located at military bases across Hampton Roads. There is also an,
office located on Naval Station Norfolk where questions about,
TRAFFIX services are answered on a walk-in basis as well.,
The biggest gain in outreach during FY 2011 was the outreach to,
new businesses. TRAFFIX staff focused on businesses in downtown,
"Norfolk to encourage usage of the Tide Light Rail, which opened",
near the beginning of FY 2012. This outreach resulted in a doubling,
of new business visits in FY 2011 as compared to FY 2010.,
TRAFFIX staff also revisits worksites in order to assure continuity,
"in previous commitments and reach new employees. In FY 2011,",
TRAFFIX staff revisited 245 businesses.,
TRAFFIX Annual Report 2012,3
Actions – Park and Ride,
TRAFFIX encourages ride-sharing by promoting and administering park and,
ride lots. There are currently 20 park & ride lots in Hampton Roads including,
a park & sail lot for the Paddlewheel Ferry and four park & ride lots for The,
Tide light rail.,
TRAFFIX created or brokered the park and ride locations indicated by,
"“TRAFFIX” on the map, and promotes the remaining park and ride lots to",
"commuters who wish to carpool, vanpool, or ride public transit.",
TRAFFIX provides assigned parking spots at the Park & Sail lot in Portsmouth,
for commuters who use the lot a minimum of three times per week. This,
service has declined from 103 spaces assigned in FY 2008 to 57 spaces,
assigned in FY 2011.,

Outcomes – Vanpools,
TRAFFIX provides vanpools for lease to groups of commuters. As of the end,
"of FY 2011, all 60 of TRAFFIX’s vans had been leased, along with two vans",
owned by VPSI (a private vanpool company). As vans leased through VPSI,
"are more costly than vans leased through TRAFFIX, there are 34 individuals",
on a waiting list for TRAFFIX vans as of the end of FY 2011. The average,
number of commuters per vanpool has ranged between 9 and 10 commuters,
over the past five years. The vanpool program is serving 613 commuters as,
of the end of FY 2011.,

Financial - Income,
The HRTPO Board funds TRAFFIX using federal Congestion Mitigation and,
Air Quality (CMAQ) funds. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) limits,
CMAQ funds to projects and programs that reduce the amount of pollutants,
in the air.,
Recognizing the impact that TRAFFIX has on reducing the number of,
"vehicles on the roadway – and therefore vehicle emissions – in the region,",
the HRTPO recently allocated CMAQ funding for TRAFFIX for the next few,
"years. In March 2010, the HRTPO Board allocated $1,000,000 per year in",
"CMAQ, including state match, for FY 2011 through FY 2015. In March 2011,",
"the $1,000,000 per year CMAQ allocation was extended through FY 2017",
"in March 2011. In December 2011, $1,100,000 was allocated for FY 2018.",
With previous CMAQ and Regional Surface Transportation Program (RSTP),
"allocations, TRAFFIX has received a total of $24,578,189 in allocations to",
support programs from FY 1995 to FY 2018.,
TRAFFIX Annual Report 2012,11
Financial – Budgets vs Spending,
"TRAFFIX had an annual budget of $1,015,046 for FY 2011. Almost half of",
the budget is dedicated to salaries and benefits for the TRAFFIX employees,
who administer the various TRAFFIX programs and meet with businesses,
to promote alternate transportation. Approximately a quarter of the budget,
"is allocated for obtaining professional services, which include the NuRide",
"program, printing services, and graphic design. The remaining budget is",
"divided between advertising, materials and supplies, Guaranteed Ride, and",
other various small programs.,
The budgeted amounts for FY 2011 match the budgeted amounts for FY,
"2010. During both years, although TRAFFIX spent more on Professional",
"Services than it had budgeted, it underspent its total budget. In FY 2012, the",
Advertising budget increased and there was a decrease in the Professional,
Services budget.,
TRAFFIX Annual Report 2012,12
Financial – FY 2011 Spending,
"During FY 2011, TRAFFIX spent 88% of its budget. This was partially due to",
receiving its CMAQ funds halfway through the fiscal year. While waiting for,
"funding, TRAFFIX scaled back its programs to the bare minimum. Although",
"TRAFFIX spent more on Professional Services than budgeted, there was",
enough balance left in other categories to cover the overage. TRAFFIX,
"ended FY 2011 with a surplus of $115,415.88.",
"Under CMAQ policies, the unspent balance must be expended within 4 years",
"of obligation, which means that TRAFFIX can use the remaining balance",
from FY 2011 in future fiscal years.,
TRAFFIX Annual Report 2012,13
Summary,
"The TRAFFIX program is an important part of the Hampton Roads transportation system, encouraging the reduction of single",
occupancy vehicles on the roadways through its many programs. TRAFFIX had success in FY 2011 in expanding many,
"programs and serving many people in Hampton Roads. However, there are a few instances where this growth is limited, namely",
"Telework!VA and vanpooling. Consequently, TRAFFIX may wish to consider budgeting for the purchase of additional vans in",
future years.,
"This annual report was completed by HRTPO staff to inform the TOS, TPS, TTAC, and HRTPO Board of TRAFFIX performance.",
"It provides a template and baseline data set for future annual reports to be completed by TRAFFIX. Using the consistent,",
"meaningful performance measures shown in this report, the TOS can monitor the impact of TRAFFIX on Hampton Roads and",
ensure that the allocations given to TRAFFIX are at an appropriate level.,
This report reflects the programs and performance measures in place during FY 2011. Additional performance measures should,
be collected so that the number of person-trips reduced per year can be calculated for all TRAFFIX programs. The performance,
measures for the NuRide program can also be enhanced by tracking the number of trips by mode that are reported in NuRide.,
"As TRAFFIX implements new programs, it can add additional performance measures. One such program for FY 2012 is the",
"Go365 program, which allows schools and businesses to purchase a years’ worth of unlimited rides for their students and",
"employees. Suggested performance measures for this program include the number of schools and businesses participating,",
"the number of individuals eligible for Go365 passes, and the number of rides taken using Go365 passes (as tracking becomes",
available).,
