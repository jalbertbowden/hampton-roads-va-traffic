Actions - Outreach,
TRAFFIX staff makes an effort every year to visit local employers to,
"promote alternative commuting options. During visits to worksites,",
TRAFFIX staff provides information on the various TRAFFIX programs,
as well as answers specific questions on alternative commuting,
options available to the employees at that particular worksite.,
"Since 2008, TRAFFIX has designated a specific staff member as the",
Military and Government Outreach Coordinator. This has allowed,
"the military outreach to grow each year, from 10 commands in FY",
2007 to 105 commands in FY 2011. The Military and Government,
Outreach Coordinator contacts and visits individual commands,
located at military bases across Hampton Roads. There is also an,
office located on Naval Station Norfolk where questions about,
TRAFFIX services are answered on a walk-in basis as well.,
The biggest gain in outreach during FY 2011 was the outreach to,
new businesses. TRAFFIX staff focused on businesses in downtown,
"Norfolk to encourage usage of the Tide Light Rail, which opened",
near the beginning of FY 2012. This outreach resulted in a doubling,
of new business visits in FY 2011 as compared to FY 2010.,
TRAFFIX staff also revisits worksites in order to assure continuity,
"in previous commitments and reach new employees. In FY 2011,",
TRAFFIX staff revisited 245 businesses.,
