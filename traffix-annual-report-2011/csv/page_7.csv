Introduction,
TRAFFIX was established in 1995 as a Transportation Demand Management (TDM) service for Hampton Roads. The service,
aims to reduce traffic congestion by reducing the number of single occupancy vehicles commuting to work. The service,
"promotes transportation alternatives, such as carpooling, vanpooling, public transportation, teleworking, and alternate work",
schedules.,
"TRAFFIX staff are employees of Hampton Roads Transit (HRT); however, funding is provided through the Hampton Roads",
Transportation Planning Organization (HRTPO). The HRTPO has authorized annual funding for TRAFFIX through Congestion,
Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) and/or Regional Surface Transportation Program (RSTP) funding since Fiscal Year (FY) 1995.,
"The TRAFFIX Oversight Subcommittee (TOS), made up of transportation professionals from the cities and counties in the",
"Metropolitan Planning Area (MPA), the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT), Federal Highway Administration (FHWA),",
"and the Virginia Department of Rail and Public Transportation (DRPT), reviews the progress and status of TRAFFIX three times",
"per year. The TOS reports to the Transportation Technical Advisory Committee (TTAC), which in turn reports to the HRTPO",
board.,
TRAFFIX administers many programs internally and also advertises TDM programs administered by outside organizations.,
"The Commuter Computer, Vanpool Program, Guaranteed Ride Program, and park & ride lots are operated by TRAFFIX, while",
NuRide and Telework!VA are programs of other agencies which TRAFFIX promotes for Hampton Roads.,
"Although TRAFFIX has provided performance measures to the TOS and TTAC in the past, this report expands on the previous",
performance measures and creates a standardized list of performance measures for TRAFFIX. While TRAFFIX began operations,
"in 1995, the detailed performance data that TRAFFIX provided for this report is available beginning with FY 2007, and thus the",
"baseline data provided in this report covers FY 2007 through FY 2011. Throughout this report, the fiscal year refers to the state",
