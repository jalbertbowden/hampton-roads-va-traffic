Diversion	Rates	for	Closures	of
River	Crossings	in	Hampton	Roads
""
August	2013
""
Note:
"These	rates	are	based	on	existing	conditions,	i.e.	Jordan	Bridge	is	the	only	tolled	river"
crossing.		These	rates	are	expected	to	change	significantly	with	implementation	of	tolls	on
"Downtown	and	Midtown	Tunnels,	not	only	on	those	tunnels,	but	also	on	other	crossings."
